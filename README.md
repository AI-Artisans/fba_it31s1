# 🧠💾 Fundamentals of Bus Analytics Repository (a.k.a. The Labyrinth of Data Madness)

Welcome, brave 3rd Year IT student of TIP!  
You have stumbled into the **official** (and questionably organized) realm of **Fundamentals of Bus Analytics** lab work. 🎉

This repo is your new best friend (until finals), containing:

- 📁 Laboratory exercise submissions (aka your ticket to passing)
- 📚 Supporting documents (some useful, some ancient scrolls)
- 🧪 Bonus brain cells (not guaranteed)

---

## 🧪 What Is This Sorcery?

This repository is where you'll dump—err, **submit**—your precious lab exercises for the semester. Think of it as your digital lab notebook, minus the coffee stains.

We’ll be wrangling data so big, it could crash your laptop.  
But hey, that’s what makes it fun. Right? Right?!

## 📂 Folder Structure (Probably)

Everything is neatly tucked away using a meticulous directory structure because...we’re professionals like that:

### Directory Structure
📂 https://github.com/AI-Artisans/fba_it31s1 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|- 📂 Main&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#C2C0C0"><i>&lt;-- branch</i></span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|- 📂 [Name in LastNameFNMI]&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#C2C0C0"><i>&lt;-- branch</i></span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|- 📂 LAB-[LaboratoryDate: yyyymmdd]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|- 📂 final-project<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|- 📂 Tags<br>

### Example:
📂 https://github.com/AI-Artisans/fba_it31s1 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|- 📂 Main<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|- 📂 DelaCruzJTI<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|- 📂 LAB-20250809<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|- 📂 final-project<br>

### Naming Conventions:
1. Each student must create their own GitHub branch using the naming convention:
   **[Last Name][First Name Initial][Middle Initial]**
   _(E.g., `DelaCruzJTI` for Juan Tamad Inantok Dela Cruz)._

2. **Laboratory Submissions**:
   - Inside your branch, create a new folder for each laboratory session with the format:
     **`LAB-[yyyymmdd]`**
     _(E.g., `LAB-20250809` for the lab session on August 9, 2025)._

3. **Final Project Submission**:
   - Your final project should be added inside the `final-project/` folder within your branch. 
   - Use a separate branch name for project submission, as instructed later in the course.

Note: Folder names subject to change due to panic, typos, or last-minute professor updates. 😅

### 🛠️ How To Contribute (Because Sharing is Scaring)

#### 🧙‍♂️ Welcome to the FBA-IT31S1 Chaosverse!  

Because sharing isn’t just caring — it’s mildly terrifying and may involve summoning Git demons. If you’re reading this, congratulations: you’ve chosen the path of bravery (or confusion). Either way, here’s your scroll of instructions to enter the sacred realm of contribution.

First, you must **clone** the sacred code to your lair — this is the digital equivalent of stealing a spellbook and promising to return it:  
`git clone https://github.com/AI-Artisans/fba_it31s1.git`

Then, **spy on the remote branches**, because knowing is half the battle (the other half is debugging):  
`git branch -r`

Next, **switch to the MatangSisiw branch**, the all-seeing chick that holds all truth (and code):  
`git switch origin/MatangSisiw`  
*If your Git throws a tantrum and refuses to switch like a moody teenager, try:*  
`git checkout origin/MatangSisiw`

Once inside the nest, **pull the latest changes** — freshly hatched updates await:  
`git pull origin/MatangSisiw`

Now it’s time to **check your status** like a sneaky ninja monitoring footprints in the sand:  
`git status`

Then, bravely **stage all your changes**, even the ones you forgot existed:  
`git add .`

Now comes the sacred ritual of **commitment** — declare your intentions to the Git gods (and future devs):  
`git commit -m "Trying to send my nothing-ness."`

Finally, **push it to the branch** and pray the CI/CD spirits are in your favor:  
`git push origin/MatangSisiw`

🎉 You’ve done it! You’ve contributed to the Madness. Take a break, drink some water, write your autobiography, or stare into the void while questioning life choices. And remember:

_"With great Git comes great commit messages."_  
🪄 *Made with typos, hope, and caffeine.*

## 📜 Rules of the Repo (aka the Fine Print)

- ☑️ Submit your own work (your cat can’t code, we checked)
- ☑️ Respect deadlines (time waits for no coder)
- ☑️ Use meaningful commit messages (e.g., `fixed lab 2` = meh, `exorcised bugs from lab 2` = chef’s kiss)
- ☑️ No pushing to `main` unless you’ve been granted the sacred powers
