To convert a .CSV file to .ARFF with built-in sanitation, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Python is installed and properly configured on your system (i.e., you can run Python from the command line).
2. Place both the .CSV and .PY files in the same directory.
3. Open a command line window and execute the script from within that directory:

$> python csvconverter.py dataset.csv dataset.arff
